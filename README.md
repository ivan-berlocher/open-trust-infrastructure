[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.17940484.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17940484)

**Author:** Ivan Berlocher

---

A complete, infrastructure-level exploration of language, cognition, and trust in systems that execute actions rather than display information.

This is not a novel.  
This is not a thesis.  
This is not a product.

The text develops a full cognitive architecture, from representation and reasoning to execution and governance.
